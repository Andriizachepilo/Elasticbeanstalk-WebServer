Project Description: Todo List Application with User Authentication and MongoDB Integration
Welcome to our Todo List Application project! This ongoing endeavor aims to develop a robust todo list application with user authentication features, seamless MongoDB integration, and deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Key Features
User Authentication: Our application prioritizes user security, offering a seamless registration and login process to ensure that users can securely access their todo lists.
Todo List Management: With our application, users can effortlessly create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed within their todo lists, helping them stay organized and productive.
MongoDB Integration: Leveraging the power of MongoDB, we've integrated a flexible and scalable database solution to store and manage user accounts and todo list items efficiently.
Elastic Beanstalk Deployment: Our application environment is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, allowing for easy deployment and management of our application for public access.
Application Load Balancer: To ensure reliability and scalability, all incoming traffic is routed through an Application Load Balancer, optimizing performance and user experience.
Future Plans: While the core functionality is in place, we're continuously working on enhancing our application. In the near future, we plan to deploy CloudWatch to monitor user login activities and application performance metrics. Additionally, we're exploring the implementation of a chatbot feature to provide users with real-time assistance and support within the application.


Current Status
While our project is still a work in progress, we're excited about the progress we've made so far. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine and enhance our application!
